<p>
 Note: the subteam owner is the first/leftmost person listed next to the subteam name on
 <a href="https://tasks.opencraft.com/secure/RapidBoard.jspa?rapidView=5" target="_blank">
  the Weekly Sprint board
 </a>
 . When that person is away, the next leftmost person listed there
 will be the acting subteam owner.

<p>
 As a
 <strong>subteam owner</strong>:
</p>
<ol>
 <li>
  I will make sure the subteam has groomed and assigned all of its stories
  before Monday's meeting. (I will use the asynchronous grooming tool
  to let the subteam help groom the stories, unless the pointing of the stories
  is very obvious/non-controversial or there is not enough time for asynchronous
  grooming session.).
 </li>
 <li>
  I will aim for the subteam's volume of work each month to match the monthly
  hour goals (not too low nor too high) - except for the small projects subteam
  where this doesn't apply.

   This report
  </a>
  can be used to see each client account's monthly hour totals,
  although you may need to add a few rows together to figure out the subteam total.
