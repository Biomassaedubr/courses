  <strong>Internal review</strong>:
  Finished tasks that wait for an in-house review.
</p>
<p>
  The reviewer will look over the code and test it, leaving feedback
  on the pull request. Once all of the reviewers' concerns have been addressed,
  the reviewer should give a "" (+1 / thumbs up) comment to indicate
  that they've approved the PR. The task can then proceed to the next column,
  which is usually "External Review."
  <br />
  If the corrections to be made are fairly trivial, the reviewer should
  give a conditional +1, e.g. say "+1 if you fix the minor issues a and b."
  That way, the author won't be blocked waiting for a trivial follow-up review.
  <br />
  If there are many corrections to be made, the task should be moved back to
  <strong>In Progress</strong>
  by the reviewer.
