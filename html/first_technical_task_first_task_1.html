<p>
 Once you have your first technical task assigned by CTO
 you can start working on it.
</p>
<p>
 The simplest workflow would be:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>
   <span>
    Change the JIRA status of the ticket you're going to work on to
   </span>
   <em>
    In Progress
   </em>
   <span>
    .
   </span>
  </li>
  <li>
   <span>
    Do
   </span>
   <code>
    git checkout
   </code>
   <span>
    of the master branch in the repository you're going to work with. Pull from remote.
   </span>
  </li>
  <li>
   <span>
    Create a new branch of the master branch. You can name it like:
   </span>
   <code>
    your_name/name_of_the_new_feature
   </code>
   <span>
    .
   </span>
  </li>
  <li>
   <span>
    Implement a new feature.
   </span>
  </li>
  <li>
   <span>
    Test your code, both manually and with tests, and make sure
    your code passes quality checks and is generally high-standard
    and readable for a reviewer.
   </span>
  </li>
  <li>
   <span>
    Push your branch to remote.
   </span>
  </li>
  <li>
   <span>
    Open a pull request on GitHub.
   </span>
  </li>
  <li>
   <span>
    Change the JIRA status of your ticket to
   </span>
   <em>
    Internal review
   </em>
   <span>
    and ping your reviewer.
   </span>
 </li>
</ol>
<p>
 <strong>
  Important note:
 </strong>
</p>
<p>
 The scenario above describes the simplest possible workflow but please
 do note that workflows can differ drastically for different tasks
 and one needs to ultimately figure out what works best through experience.

  for more specific scenarios; but again, you should be adaptable.
