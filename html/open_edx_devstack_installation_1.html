<p>
 Please install
 <strong>the master branch of the Open edX developer stack</strong>. There are two versions of it:
</p>
<ul>
 <li>
  <a href="https://github.com/open-craft/documentation/blob/master/docker-devstack" target="_blank">a newer Docker version</a>
  (the
  <em>README</em>
  of its GitHub repo has pretty explicit, simple, well-tested steps on how it's setup)
 </li>
 <li>
  an older Vagrant devstack (to get it up and running, please follow
  <a href="https://github.com/open-craft/documentation/blob/master/devstack_setup.md" target="_blank">OpenCraft custom instructions</a>,
  <a href="http://edx.readthedocs.io/projects/edx-installing-configuring-and-running/en/latest/installation/devstack/install_devstack.html" target="_blank">edX simple instruction</a>
  or
  <a href="https://openedx.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/OpenOPS/pages/60227787/Running+Devstack" target="_blank">complete explanations</a>)
 </li>
</ul>
<p>
 From the experience of the past newcomers it seems like the Docker devstack
 is easier to get started with. Although, for some tasks (e.g. McKinsey)
 you may need a Vagrant devstack. If you're not sure which one to choose,
 please ask the reviewer of your on-boarding JIRA task.
