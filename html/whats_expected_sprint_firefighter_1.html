  As a
  <strong>sprint firefighter</strong>:
 </span>
</p>
<ol>
 <li>
  I will keep at least 10 hours of time for sprint firefighter duties as
  described below, and will proactively pursue those duties.
  I may still plan some tasks to pull into the sprint if no fires pop up.
 </li>
 <li>
  I will not record any time on the
  <a href="https://tasks.opencraft.com/browse/OC-1199" target="_blank">
   OC-1199
  </a>
  task directly (always use a dedicated client story/bug/epic ticket).
 </li>
 <li>
  I will be subscribed to the
  <a href="http://mail.plebia.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/help" target="_blank">
   help
  </a>
  and
  <a href="http://mail.plebia.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/urgent" target="_blank">
   urgent
  </a>
  mailing lists (be sure to filter them to a separate folder
  to look at them only when you need to - but also make sure
  that if any such emails also explicitly include you in the To/CC,
  then they will arrive in your inbox).
 </li>
 <li>
  I will work on the following, listed by decreasing priority:
 </li>
 <ol>
  <li>
   <span>
    Handle emergencies from other team members
    (reported by team members directly to me or to the other sprint
    firefighter, with Braden arbitrating priorities)
   </span>
  </li>
  <li>
   <span>
    Handle emergencies reported by clients (these will come in through the
   </span>
   <a href="mailto:help@opencraft.com" target="_blank">
    help@opencraft.com
   </a>
   <span>
    mailing list, which everyone receives, though for anything other
    than obviously unexpected downtime, the firefighters should wait
    for Xavier or Braden to triage and prioritize the issue).
   </span>
  </li>
  <li>
   <span>
    Handle critical bugs reported by QA
   </span>
  </li>
  <li>
   <span>
    Deploying hotfixes/security fixes on client instances
   </span>
  </li>
  <li>
   <span>
    Provide reviews for tasks that are missing a reviewer.
   </span>
  </li>
  <li>
   <span>
    Complete any personal spillover from the previous sprint
   </span>
  </li>
  <li>
   <span>
    Being in Hipchat (#dev) and Slack(#general), answering questions &amp;
    responding to emergencies reported there (log time on OC-1017)
   </span>
  </li>
  <li>
   <span>
    Sprint ETA/Follow-up &amp; ensuring clean sprint
    (helping to finish tickets if necessary)
   </span>
  </li>
  <li>
   <span>
    Watch over sandboxes (ie keep an eye on the instance manager
    on a daily basis to ensure they build correctly, and debugging if needed)
   </span>
  </li>
  <li>
   <span>
    Providing support on the mailing-list, monitoring for questions
    on features we made (log time on OC-1017)
   </span>
  </li>
  <li>
   <span>
    Work on additional tasks from the backlog if additional time is available
   </span>
  </li>
 </ol>
</ol>
<p>
 Also, if I am
 <strong>
  Firefighter 1
</strong>
 :
</p>
<ul>
 <li>
  I will lead the meeting on Monday
 </li>
 <li>
  On Wednesday at the end of the day, I will do a sprint checkin
  on all "backlog" and "In progress" tickets (this means to post a comment
  on each ticket to ask how the assignee is doing and if they need help,
  and/or asking them to update the status of the ticket if it is not clear).
 </li>
</ul>
