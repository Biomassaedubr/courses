<p>
  This category is for tasks that are waiting for an external review
  or some other external requirement, and are not expected to be unblocked
  before the end of the current sprint. If any tasks in this category
  are assigned to you, you should review them once a week to see
  if you need to ping the external party to remind them to review/unblock it,
  or if you are ready to pull it back into a sprint.
