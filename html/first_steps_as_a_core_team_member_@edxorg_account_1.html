  When edX IT has set up an @edx.org email address for you, log in that
  Gmail account and configure it to forward all incoming mail to your
  @opencraft.com address.

  (We do not use @edx.org addresses for sending mail; it's only to allow us
  to access Google Docs and Calendars shared with the edX organization.)
