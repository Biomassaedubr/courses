  I use
  <a href="https://github.com/projecthamster/hamster" target="_blank">
   Project Hamster
  </a>
  , which I find has a very quick, easy, reliable interface. It's a GTK
  project, but I believe it's tightly integrated with other components in the
  freedesktop/GNOME ecosystem, so it would probably be difficult if not impossible
  to make it work outside of Linux or FreeBSD.
 </p>
 <p>
  Either way, I imagine there are plenty of tools that do just as good
  a job for Windows or macOS.
 </p>
 <p>
  My usual pattern is this:
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   <span>
    For keeping track of larger tasks during the day (things I think
    will take &gt; 10-15 minutes), I track these directly with Hamster.
    I actually copy and paste the full name of the OpenCraft ticket
    into Hamster when I start logging; this makes logging the time on JIRA
    much easier later on.
   </span>
  </li>
  <li>
   <span>
    I try to remain at Inbox Zero as much as possible, so I respond
    to most small things immediately, prioritize my email as a task list
    for stuff I choose not to respond to immediately (usually when
    they're bigger notifications), and clear out the bigger notifications in
    between tasks (for this, it helps to use
   </span>
   <a href="https://inbox.google.com/" target="_blank">
    Google Inbox
   </a>
   <span>
    instead of Gmail, although there are some downsides to it
    and the OpenCraft org itself doesn't have Inbox enabled).
   </span>
  </li>
  <li>
   <span>
    For the smaller email notifications (usually &lt; 10 minutes),
    I log my time directly on the corresponding JIRA tickets right away
    using the 'W' hotkey and tabbing through the fields.
    It takes no time at all to enter worklogs this way, and there's no point
    in tossing this stuff into Hamster since they're so small.
   </span>
  </li>
  <li>
   <span>
    At the end of my day, I go to the
   </span>
   <a href="https://tasks.opencraft.com/secure/TempoUserView.jspa" target="_blank">
    Worklog Calendar
   </a>
   <span>
    view In JIRA and record all the time I have recorded in OpenCraft.
   </span>
  </li>
 </ul>
