  I do more or less what Brandon does, except that I use
  <a href="http://www.k5n.us/gtimer.php?topic=Screenshots" target="_blank">GTimer</a>
  instead of Hamster. It's quite simple, but rather idiosyncratic,
  and the only reason I'm using it is because the Xubuntu Hamster package
  was broken at the time I looked for a time tracking tool
  and I could not be bothered to compile it myself.

 <p>
  For small tasks, I just start a stopwatch on my phone and enter the time
  directly into Jira once I'm done. This may seem somewhat crude,
  but it's still a lot better than the Tempo time tracker on Jira.
