 <strong>
  Backlog:
 </strong>
 Most tasks start here.
</p>
<p>
 The tasks at the top of the backlog are the ones with the highest priority.
 It is usually Xavier or Braden who create and prioritize the tickets
 according to the client's needs; except during discovery tasks for large epics,
 when the person who does the discovery will create the tasks.
 In general, if you have an idea for a new task,
 don't hesitate to ask either Braden or Xavier, or propose it on UserVoice.
