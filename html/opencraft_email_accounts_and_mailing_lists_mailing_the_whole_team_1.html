  If you need to email the whole company, you can send an email to <a href="mailto:all@opencraft.com">all@opencraft.com</a>, or for just the developer team, to <a href="mailto:dev@opencraft.com">dev@opencraft.com</a>. However, try to use the other communications tools, especially the task tracker, rather than email - it makes it easier to keep things in one place.

  If you need to ask questions which are not related to any task, e.g. about holidays or contract,
  email
  <a href="mailto:braden@opencraft.com">Braden</a>
  or
  <a href="mailto:xavier@opencraft.com">Xavier</a>.
