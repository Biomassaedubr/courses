 <strong>Welcome to the team!</strong>
</p>
<p>
  This course is meant to help you to get started, and become familiar
  with the most common parts of the way we work. We recommend you go through it
  progressively, taking time to become familiar with the elements in each sections,
  ahead of your start date (log the time spent so you can invoice it).
  It will likely answer a good number of the questions that you might have
  as you get started.
