 Read the
 <a href="https://openedx.atlassian.net/wiki/display/ENG/Developer+Onboarding" target="_blank">
  edX onboarding document
 </a>
 (it's for edX internal developers, but a lot of it will also apply to you).
 You do not have to email edX or request any accounts from IT as it says -
 we'll take care of that for you.

 If you cannot access the document,
 <a href="https://github.com/open-craft/documentation/blob/master/pdfs/edx-onboarding-copy-2017-25-07.pdf" target="_blank">
  there is a copy here
 </a>
 though it may be less up-to-date.
