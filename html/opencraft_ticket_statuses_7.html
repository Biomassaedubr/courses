 <strong>Ready for merge</strong>:
 Finished internal review, and external review (if applicable);
 ready for merge.
</p>
<p>
 Once all comments from the review have been fixed
 to the satisfaction of the reviewers, and every reviewer has given their +1,
 the task is ready for merge. The reviewer who gives the final +1 should
 move the task into this column (or you can as the assignee).
 If you can merge the PR yourself, go ahead and do so; if you can't,
 then ping Braden to let him know this is good to merge &amp;
 deliver to the client.
