 <li>
  I can work from wherever I want, provided I have access
  to a reliable high-bandwidth internet connection good enough for video calls.
 </li>
 <li>
  I can set my own work schedule, and work when I want during the week,
  as long as
  <strong>
   I remain available to answer to others
  </strong>
  (please see: the
  <strong>
   Comunication
  </strong>
  section below)
 </li>
 <li>
  (In general)
  <strong>
   I am expected
   <em>
    not
   </em>
   to work weekends
 </strong>
  (unless I'm behind on my commitments).
 </li>
 <li>
   I will work at least the amount of hours per week that is
   specified in my contract (e.g. 40 hours/week),
   averaged over each month, excluding scheduled holiday time.
 </li>
 <li>
  I will ensure that clients and people on the team that I'll be working with
  (e.g. code reviews) know my availability.
  (e.g. If I'm taking Friday off, I'll make sure people who need me
  to do code review know that).
 </li>
 <li>
  When taking time off (including any Mondays, or anytime I want more
  than one work day in a row off), I will check with Xavier first,
  and ask at least two weeks in advance
  (one month in advance for a week or more of vacation).
  <ul>
   <li>
    This includes national holidays and Christmas, etc. so I'll make sure
    to request those dates off if I want them off (as an international team,
    we don't take any holidays off by default).
   </li>
  </ul>
 </li>
 <li>
  If I'm unexpectedly sick or unavailable due to an emergency,
  I'll make every effort to notify the team and ask the sprint firefighters
  to take over my duties.
 </li>
 <li>
  I will provide my own hardware (laptop).
 </li>
 <li>
  I will keep my computer(s) secure and up to date as described in the
  <a href="https://github.com/open-craft/documentation/blob/master/Security_policy.md">
   Security Policy</a>.
 </li>
 <li>
  I will record all hours that I spend on a task using the Tempo timesheets
  tool in JIRA (including things like setting up devstacks and time spent
  learning, which we all need to do and is an important part of the task,
  especially at the beginning, or when joining a project).
 </li>
 <li>
  If I use another tool for tracking my time,
  I will update the JIRA Tempo timesheets within 24 hours (excluding weekend days).
 </li>
</ol>
