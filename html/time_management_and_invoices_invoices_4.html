 <strong>
  What details should I include in my invoice?
</strong>
</h3>
<blockquote>
 <ol>
  <li>
    Only include time from the first through the last day of the month
    (i.e. if you send your invoice on November 3rd, do not include work
    done on November 1st and 2nd. You would only invoice for October 1st-31st).
  </li>
  <li>
    Include total number of hours worked for the month.
  </li>
  <li>
    Make sure the invoice matches your worklogs in JIRA exactly before sending.
    If your generated invoice differs by even a fraction, you will need
    to manually change your invoice to match your Jira worklog.
    Double check the math before sending in.
  </li>
  <li>
    Make sure the OpenCraft address is included on your invoice:
  </li>
 </ol>
 <p>
  OpenCraft GmbH
 </p>
 <p>
  c/o Dr. Jan Timmann
 </p>
 <p>
  Jerusalemer Str. 14
 </p>
 <p>
  10117 Berlin
 </p>
 <p>
  Germany
 </p>
 <ol start="5">
  <li>
    If it's a first invoice or the bank details change,
    include your local bank account details (the entity holding the account
    and its address must match the address for you in your contract)
    including VAT, IBAN, SWIFT, account number, routing number or any other
    applicable details.
  </li>
  <li>
    Include
   <a href="mailto:billing@opencraft.com">
    billing@opencraft.com
   </a>
    when you send your invoice. A reminder email will be sent out
    to everyone - make sure to only respond to
   <a href="mailto:billing@opencraft.com">
    billing@opencraft.com
   </a>
    to keep these details private.
  </li>
  <li>
   On your first invoice, please include the currency you'd like your transfer
   converted to from euros (this should match currency based on bank address)
   so invoice processor can confirm correct information.
  </li>
  <li>
   If you are going on holiday the first week of the month, send invoice before leaving.
  </li>
  <li>
   Please include one line item for each ticket with total hours.
   It's up to you how you want to format it. Use what template and/or service
   you're comfortable working with. Your invoice should look more or less like this:
  </li>
 </ol>
