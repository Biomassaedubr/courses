  I use
  <a href="https://toggl.com/" target="_blank">toggl</a>
  because it's really simple and flexible to use (compared to Tempo),
  and then at the end of each day I use the Worklog Calendar view in Tempo
  to copy my time entries over into Tempo.
 </p>
 <p>
  I generally start a timer on toggl, then work for a bit on a bunch of related work,
  then go back to toggl and enter a quick note about which task/epic I worked on
  and what I did. What I like about toggl is that it's easy
  to retroactively split up time entries if it turned out to be more than one project.
 </p>
 <p>
  I get a lot of emails from many different projects that we work on,
  so I have filters that automatically label (most) emails by client,
  and then I usually go through my emails client by client.
  So I'll read all the McKinsey emails, then record a time entry for that,
  then read all the Management emails, then record a time entry for that, etc.
  That makes it easier to track my time per epic, and since I do it per-client
  and not per-epic, the labelling itself is not too much admin overhead.
