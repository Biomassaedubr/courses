<p>
 Make sure that your laptop's home folder/partition (or your whole disk)
 is encrypted, and that any backups of your data are also encrypted. This is
 important to reduce the risk of someone being able to obtain sensitive data
 (like client passwords, browser session cookies, etc.) if your laptop is
 stolen/lost.
