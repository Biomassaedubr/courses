  I tried using time trackers in the past, but it didn't work for me.
  I found it was too much overhead to switch the tracker every 5 minutes
  when answering another mail. I would also often forget to start, stop,
  or switch to a different customer when switching projects, so now I just do it
  manually. The fact that I start working at the same time every day makes it
  easier (don't have to remember to check the clock every time when I start:)).

  In order to keep things manageable, I log time in 0.5 hour chunks.
  I don't keep track of each individual 5 minute email -
  if I'm answering emails for 30 minutes, I will log all 30 minutes
  to the client for which I spent most of that 30 minutes.
  In theory the logged time should even up over time.
