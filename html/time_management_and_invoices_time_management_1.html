  The way we track time has an effect on our productivity. Each person
  tends to find their own comfort zone here, depending on their setup, their work
  habits, etc.. This section should shed some light on different methods of time
  management and time tracking used by some on the team, to help you in working
  out what may be optimal for yourself.

  To help you in dealing with the potential mysteries revolving
  around tracking and managing their time in the several different types of tasks
  and activities here at OpenCraft, we've compiled a QA section
  with the most common queries from past newcomers.

<p>
 Q: Do I need to use the time tracker app on JIRA?
</p>
<blockquote>
 <p>
  A: No! As you'll read from our team's personal tips (in the next unit),
  there are only a few people on the team that actually use JIRA's plugin
  for time tracking. However, because it's directly in JIRA, it won't necessitate
  the extra step of transfering work logs, so give it a try in case it ends up
  being perfectly fine for you!

<p>
 Q: How precise does tracked time need to be?
 (Is a quarter hour sufficient if not using the time tracker?)
</p>
<blockquote>
 <p>
  For tracking time in sprint planning, if you look at specific epics
  you should assign this time to the epics themselves (splitting
  roughly over a given period of time, it doesn't need to be 100% exact).
  Or on the tickets themselves if you read them. For things like the meeting itself,
  or things in sprint planning that aren't related to any epic, there is OC-515,
  but it should be kept to a minimum, since we can't differentiate which projects
  the time logged on that epic was spent on, which makes it difficult
  to properly invoice clients afterwards.
 </p>
 <p>
  It's good in general to be precise about time logging - whenever possible,
  use the exact measurement from the tracker - it's not uncommon
  to be surprised by the amount of time we spend on specific tasks
  once we start tracking it. However, to keep the amount of time spent logging
  time sane, when you work for short amount of times switching between
  a set of tasks or epics, it can become difficult to use a timer efficiently
  - you can then divide the time roughly - you look at how much time
  you've spent in total (say, 1h), and if you spent roughly
  the same amount of time on each of say 6 tasks/epics,
  you can log 10min on each. It's not too bad if it's isn't completely
  exact on very small amounts - it will average out eventually.

<p>
 Q: Where do I track time for sprint planning or really small tasks?
</p>
<blockquote>
 <p>
  On the tasks or epics for which you spent time planning/grooming.
  For example, for the Enterprise team, if you spend time in the grooming meeting,
  track that time on the Enterprise epic.

</blockquote>
<p>
 Q: How often (and when) should we invoice OpenCraft, and when can I expect payment?
 What details should be included in the invoice?
</p>
<p>

  You'll learn about it soon in details in another unit of this section.
