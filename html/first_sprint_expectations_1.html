<p>
 As a newcomer you should:
</p>
<p>
</p>
<ol>
 <li>
  Not commit to more than
  <strong>
   3 points
  </strong>
  of tasks during your first week, or 5 points your second week.
  (It's really easy to over-commit at first, so keep your commitments manageable.
  You can always take on more work later in the sprint if you finish early.)
 </li>
 <li>
  Provide lots of updates to your assigned reviewer/mentor for each task,
  so they can provide timely help.
 </li>
</ol>
