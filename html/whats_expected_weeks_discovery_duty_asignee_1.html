<p>
  As the
  <strong>week's discovery duty assignee</strong>:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    I will keep at least 10 hours of time to do discovery work
    on any small leads/client requests that come up during the week.
    I may still plan some tasks to pull into the sprint if no fires pop up.
  </li>
  <li>
    If I do some discovery tasks, I will ping the sprint firefighters
    to review the result.
  </li>
  <li>
    If I feel that I am not the right person to take on a specific discovery,
    I will exchange work with other people from the sprint, to get someone else
    to do it, while I help them with their tasks.
  </li>
  <li>
    As always, if I do the discovery, I understand that I would be expected
    to complete the epic work later on if the client accepts it.
    (To avoid people being forced to commit to being the owner of big epics, any
    huge discovery stories should always be scheduled into future sprints rather
    than directly assigned to the discovery duty assignee.)
  </li>
</ol>
