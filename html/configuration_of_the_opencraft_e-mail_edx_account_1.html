<p>
 Most OpenCraft team members will also have access to an @edx.org Gmail account.
 The main purpose of this is just to allow us to access Google Docs
 that are shared with
 <em>anyone in the edx.org organization</em>.
 The @edx.org email should not be publicized or used to send mail.
 It should be configured to forward all incoming mail
 to your @opencraft.com address, to make sure you don't miss anything.
