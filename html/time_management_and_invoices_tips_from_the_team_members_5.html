    I've tried to use an external application like others once,
    and I quickly felt that the process of copying over work logs
    all the time wasn't for me.
  </p>
  <p>
    So instead, for large tasks, I often take a look at the current time
    through the phone or clock, and come back to it later
    when I feel like my task is done, and track the difference. For smaller tasks,
    I usually have a good idea of how long it'll take (i.e. 3-5 minutes),
    and don't bother with the overhead of a timer in these cases.
  </p>
  <p>
    A funny reminder for these timers: I've awkwardly forgotten in the past
    to log my time for the task while running the timer, and when I come back
    the next day there's 24+ hours of time ticking along. Don't forget to track it!
  </p>

    As for general time management, I don't think this technique will be useful
    for most people, but for me: I essentially make a mental or written down plan
    of how I'll execute my tasks for the week at the beginning.
    I then tackle each task at appropriate times depending on how much I believe
    each should take based off of my planning. This used to be impossible
    without having context with the task's content, but over time
    it's becoming pretty clear to me the path these things generally take.
