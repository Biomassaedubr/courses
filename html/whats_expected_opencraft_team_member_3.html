  <li>
    <strong>If any client email is addressed to me, I will respond to it within 24 hours(excluding weekend days), or ensure that someone else on the team does.</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>
        I will CC or forward to
        <a href="mailto:help@opencraft.com">help@opencraft.com</a>
        all client emails and replies, so that others can take over
        the thread with that client if needed, or refer to it for context.
      </li>
      <li>
        If I can't answer immediately, I will at least send a quick reply
        to let them know we're working on a response.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>I will reply to pings/emails from other OpenCraft team members within 24 hours</strong>
    (again excluding weekend days and scheduled time off).
    <ul>
      <li>
        But this should be a "worst case" scenario - completing the work on time
        is still the primary goal, so when someone is blocked and pings me for help,
        I will try to do as much as I can to unblock them quickly,
        rather than starting a 24h ping-pong cycle that takes up all the time
        in the sprint without accomplishing any work.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    I will be professional and polite when communicating with clients.
  </li>
  <li>
    I will prefer asynchronous over synchronous processes
    (keep meetings to a minimum). A chat conversation is a form of a meeting.
    <ul>
      <li>
        Generally, discussions should happen first asynchronously on the JIRA tickets;
        if there is really something that can't be efficiently sorted out asynchronously,
        have a chat or schedule a meeting. JIRA might have long response cycles (around
        1 day turnaround). If this time isn't enough to unblock someone and
        finish their sprint commitments, use Mattermost, even though
        it's more disruptive to people's workflow.</li>
      </li>
      <li>
        If you do have a synchronous conversation with someone about a particular task,
        post a summary of the result/decision from that conversation on the JIRA ticket
        for easier future reference.
      </li>
      <li>
        When scheduling meetings, give them a precise agenda. For people using Calendly,
        like Braden and Xavier, book meetings there, as it allows us to avoid
        the scheduling overhead.
      </li>
      <li>
        Try, as much as possible, to use a similar approach with clients - don't
        let them invade your days with meetings. Calendly is good for this too,
        as it allows to define time slots where you'll have the meetings,
        to minimize the disruption they cause to your day and productivity.
        If you want a calendly account, let Xavier know and he will set
        you up with the OpenCraft account.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    I will post on public channels on Mattermost rather than private 1-to-1 channels
    whenever possible, even if the message is just for one person.
    This allows us to know what others are working on, and helps to replace
    the overheard discussions in physical offices - it can also be an occasion
    for someone else with knowledge about your issue to get the context,
    and to intervene if it is useful to the conversation.
  </li>
  <li>
    I will make sure I communicate with my reviewer(s) on tasks about availability
    and timezone overlap if I didn't have knowledge about it before. I will use the
    <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/107dR9H1vWjLpJlXPuBaFJIFaEPEmaSh50xLow_aEGVw/edit" target="_blank">contact sheet</a>
    where necessary.
  </li>
  <li>
    I will join the weekly team meeting on Mondays unless I have scheduled that day off in advance.
  </li>
</ol>
