<p>
 Everyone's available time is assigned into subteams. e.g.
 If Alice works 35 hours/week, she may allocate 30h/week for "Small Projects"
 and 5 h/week for "Ocim". The subteam assignments will change from time to time.
</p>
<p>
 As a
 <strong>subteam member</strong>:
</p>
<ol>
 <li>
  I am expected to plan my tasks for each week in accordance
  with my subteam assignments, so that I'll spend roughly the expected number
  of hours on the tasks for each subteam that I'm a part of.
 </li>
 <li>
  When I'm a sprint firefighter or on discovery duty, I'll spend less time
  on "Small Projects" for that week, if I'm part of the Small Projects
  subteam. Otherwise, I'll reduce my hours from whichever team would be least
  impacted for that week, and/or ask for someone from Small Projects
  to contribute their time to replace mine on the subteam.
 </li>
</ol>
