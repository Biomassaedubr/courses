<p>
  As a
  <strong>business developer</strong>:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    I will ensure clear and prompt communication with prospects, leads and clients.
  </li>
  <li>
    I will regularly look out for business opportunities. This includes
    consulting public tendering platforms, sending cold emails to prospects,
    and attending events where you could meet prospects.
    Strategy and time spent on these tasks should be discussed with Xavier.
  </li>
  <li>
    I will send the official OpenCraft offering presentation materials to prospects.
  </li>
  <li>
    When meeting, I will describe OpenCraft’s offering,
    history and philosophy to prospects.
  </li>
  <li>
    I will quickly gather prospects’ needs through discussion.
    This enables us to know if and how we can help them.
  </li>
  <li>
    I will keep an open mind. Buyers might have needs
    that we can’t fulfill yet - this might be an opportunity
    and should be discussed with Xavier and the team.
  </li>
  <li>
    When a prospect becomes a lead, I will follow-up by providing information,
    drafting quotes, creating epics and issues and documenting in Jira
    as much as possible so the team can follow what’s happening.
  </li>
  <li>
    When managing a project, I will handle communication and coordination
    between the client and the technical team working on the project
  </li>
  <li>
    Generally, when writing to the clients, I will always make sure
    there is either contact@ or help@ CC'd:
    <ul>
      <li>
        anything related to accounting/billing/quote should be on contact@
      </li>
      <li>
        and the rest on help@
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>
