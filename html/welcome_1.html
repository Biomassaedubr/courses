 Welcome to the team! This course is meant to help you to get started,
 and become familiar with the most common parts of the way we work.
 We recommend you go through it progressively, taking time
 to become familiar with the elements in each sections,
 ahead of your start date (log the time spent so you can invoice it).
 It will likely answer a good number of the questions
 that you might have as you get started.

 You will still likely have plenty of questions though -
 don't hesitate to ask them, at any time! : )
